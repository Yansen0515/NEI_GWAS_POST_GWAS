# Genome-wide association study and functional annotation analyses for nitrogen efficiency index and its composition traits in dairy cattle

## There are two ways to download the supplemental files here：
### 1. Download the entire supplemental file (HD_supplemental_file.zip)
### 2. Download the individual supplemental file you want to view (from Supplemental file 1 to Supplemental file 6)

---
### *HD_supplemental_file.zip* contains 6 supplemental files, the 1st, 2nd, and 4th files are in Excel format, and the remaining 3 are in Word format.

The files are ordered as follows: 
- Supplemental_file_1_GO_enrichment.xlsx
- Supplemental_file_2_KEGG_enrichment.xlsx
- Supplemental_file_3_PPI_Figure_S1-S5.docx
- Supplemental_file_4_key_candidate_gene_expression_in_tissue.xlsx
- Supplemental_file_5_Figure_S6-S13_for_QTL.docx
- Supplemental_file_6_Figure_S14-S20_for_QTL_enrichment.docx

## PS: This is follow-up work for our new nitrogen efficiency index：[Defining a nitrogen efficiency index in Holstein cows and assessing its potential effect on the breeding program of bulls](https://doi.org/10.3168/jds.2021-21681)
